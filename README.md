<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Izak !</h1>

I'm a FullStack developper who started to code at 12 or 11 i forgor ðŸ’€. I started with Batch & HTML, and a bit later I learned Python. I was passionated about obfuscation so I started to make my obfuscators, and a friend wanted to collaborate with me to create more powerfull obfuscators, we built one of the most 100% Python obfuscator. Later, I learned React, then Svelte, then NextJS.
